**Xamarin Forms Maps - Test App**===This solution contains a simple cross-platform (iOS, Android and Windows Phone) application that shows an implementation of `Xamarin.Forms.Maps` component.The `MapExtended` control has a property `ContentType` that define which feature is active for the rendering process (Normal, Circle, Region or Route). It's possible to add standard pins to the map and combine it with one of the available overlays that use a custom property `Positions` of the control. Notice that the control makes a distinction between standard pins (normal behavior of the Map control) and custom positions required to create the additional overlay.**Available features (overlay)**- Circle area on a position- Region- Route
